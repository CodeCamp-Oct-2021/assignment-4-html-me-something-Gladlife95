               <p>Most of my persuasive argument will consist of photos of my cat because they speak for themselves. Vida is 2 years old, I've had her for about a year, and she's helped me get through the pandemic at home.</p>

               <p class="captions">Fun fact: Vida's birthday (the day I adopted her) is pretty sick! I adopted her on April 20th!</p>
               <img src="photos/walking.jpg" alt="Vida going for a walk" width="200">
               <p class="captions">She loves to go outside, so we go on walks! Some people might think that it's weird, but we both love it. </p>

               <p class="captions">Vida is a great study budy, but since she loves to play, I sometimes need to find ways to distract her while I work! One of her favorites is when I put on videos of birds! She might start off attentive, but usually gets worn out and falls asleep after a while...</p>
               <img src="photos/winter.jpg" alt="Someone wants to go outside" width="200">
               <p class="captions">Which can definitely make winter a bummer since I don't usually take her out in the cold and snow. She still seems pretty interested though...</p>

               <p>According to <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/worlds-most-beautiful-cats/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic">this list of the cutest cats in the world</a>, they didn't include my cat Vida. I believe that this is a mistake and will be vetoing their decision.</p>
               <p id="funParagraph">Either way, whether she receives her global recognition as the cutest cat in the world or not, she is still my best bud.❤️</p>
